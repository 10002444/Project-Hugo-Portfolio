      <br>
        <p>Hi my name is Marisa, and I am a student at Toi Ohomai Institute of Technology in Tauranga.</p>
        <p>I am a kiwi girl from New Zealand. I love chocolate, animals, makeup, photography (being in front of the camera), and computers. I love learning new things every day, gaming, hanging out with my family and exploring new areas.</p>
        <p>I am currently studying in my 2nd year of university. I have a diploma in Web Development and Design. My dream job would be to do Programming, not sure in what area yet but I know that’s what I want to do.</p>
        <p>Here is my portfoilo about my jounrey with Toi-Ohomai and what I have learnt and achieve to get where I am today :)</p>
