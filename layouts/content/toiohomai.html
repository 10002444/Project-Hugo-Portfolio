    <h4>THE STORY BEHIND OUR NAME</h4>
      <p>Toi Ohomai means to aim high and achieve great heights; to be awakened by learning.
          <br><br>Our name was gifted to us by iwi. It has a story that has been woven from our whakapapa, history and the aspirations of our communities.
        <br><br>It's a representation of institutional excellence that supports innovation, connectedness and motivates and inspires the people of the region.      
        <br><br><b>Toi</b> is the pinnacle of achievement. It inspires the pursuit of excellence.   
        <br><br>It is also a reference to Toi-te-huatahi and Toi Kai-rākau – a common eponymous ancestor of iwi across the region.      
        <br><br><b>Ohomai</b> is an awakening, to be alert and to create a shift in mindset. It is moving from a place of disillusionment to enlightenment and becoming transformed. It's also a reference to Ohomairangi, an eponymous ancestor of Te Arawa and Tainui.    
        <br><br><b>Mai</b> also represents the geographical markers of the region in which Toi Ohomai operates, Mai Maketū ki Tongariro, mai i ngā Kuri a Whārei ki Tihirau, tae atu ki te Kaokaoroa a Patatere - it acknowledges the Mana Whenua, the place of learning for the students and also the place and space from which students originate and come from, their iwi, their community, in the region and across the country.</p>
